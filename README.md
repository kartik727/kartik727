# Hello there

I am Kartik Choudhary - graduate student in the College of Information and Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. 

My interests include Natural Language Processing and Reinforcement Learning. Specifically, I want to build tools that make technology more accessible and universal.
I like working with language models, understanding how the current state-of-the-art models work and trying to figure out how to use them in novel ways. 

I am currently open to internship offers in the machine learning and NLP domains.

### Sometimes I write about ML
