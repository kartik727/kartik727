Hi! I am Kartik Choudhary - a machine learning engineer and data scientist. I like working with language models, understanding how the current state-of-the-art models work and trying to figure out how to use them in novel ways. Currently I am looking at how to make intergate autoregressive language models with models from different domains to make them more interpretable by allowing them to give natural language explanations about their working.

I am also keen on learning about how RL agents can incorporate inputs from different modalities together to get information about their state.
